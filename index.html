          <p><strong>Stephen William Hawking</strong> (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English
            theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at
            the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time
            of his death. He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of
            Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.</p>

          <p>Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of doctors. Hawking began his
            university education at University College, Oxford in October 1959 at the age of
            17, where he received a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in physics. He began his
            graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in October 1962, where he obtained his
            PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in
            general relativity and cosmology in March 1966.</p>

          <p>In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of
            motor neurone disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou
            Gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades.After the loss
            of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating
            device—initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a
            single cheek muscle.</p>

          <p>Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on
            gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and
            the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking
            radiation. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a
            union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a
            vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>

          <p>Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in
            which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief
            History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a
            record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime
            member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the
            Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.
            In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
            Britons. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor
            neurone disease for more than 50 years.</p>
